# MediTranslate+ - AI-Powered Healthcare Application

## Overview

MediTranslate+ is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to bridge language barriers in healthcare for rural Indian communities. The application provides AI-powered medical translation, health assistance chatbot, prescription scanning with OCR, and medication reminder functionalities. Built with Flask and powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, it aims to make healthcare more accessible by overcoming language barriers and providing intelligent health guidance.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Fully responsive web application with offline capabilities
- **Bootstrap 5**: Modern, mobile-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Modular ES6+ JavaScript classes for different functionalities
- **Service Worker**: Provides offline functionality and caching strategies
- **Speech APIs**: Web Speech API for voice recognition and text-to-speech
- **Camera/File APIs**: For prescription scanning and image processing

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework serving as the application server
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations with support for multiple database backends
- **Gunicorn**: WSGI HTTP server for production deployment
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4 model for medical translations and health assistance
- **Tesseract OCR**: For extracting text from prescription images
- **RESTful API**: JSON-based API endpoints for frontend communication

### Database Design
The application uses SQLAlchemy with a flexible database backend (currently SQLite for development, easily switchable to PostgreSQL for production):

- **MedicationReminder**: Stores medication schedules with time slots and dosage information
- **ChatHistory**: Maintains conversation history with language preferences
- **TranslationHistory**: Tracks translation requests for analytics and caching
- **PrescriptionScan**: Stores OCR results and extracted medication information

## Key Components

- **Features**: Camera capture, file upload, medication list generation, reminder integration

### 4. Medication Reminders
- **Purpose**: Help users maintain medication schedules
- **Implementation**: Browser notifications with customizable schedules
- **Features**: Multiple dosage schedules, notification system, tracking capabilities

## Data Flow

### Translation Workflow
1. User inputs text via typing or voice recognition
2. Speech-to-text conversion (if using voice)
3. Text sent to OpenAI API with medical context
4. Translated text returned and stored in database
5. Text-to-speech output (optional)
6. Translation history maintained for offline access

### Chatbot Interaction
1. User message received (text or voice)
2. Message sent to GPT-4 with medical assistant context
3. AI response generated with health guidance
4. Conversation stored in session history
5. Emergency keywords trigger special responses

### Prescription Processing
1. Image captured via camera or uploaded
2. Tesseract OCR extracts text from image
3. AI parses extracted text for medications
4. Structured medication data extracted
5. Option to create automatic reminders
6. Results stored for future reference

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4 model for translations and health assistance
- **Required**: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

### Image Processing
- **Tesseract**: OCR engine for prescription text extraction
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Python image processing library
- **System Dependencies**: tesseract, various image format libraries

### Web APIs
- **Web Speech API**: Browser-native speech recognition and synthesis

### Production Environment
- **Gunicorn**: Production WSGI server with multi-worker support
- **PostgreSQL**: Scalable relational database (prepared for migration)
- **Autoscale Deployment**: Configured via Replit's deployment target
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Management**: OpenAI API key stored as environment variable
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with configurable secret key
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin requests
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy connection pool configuration
- **Caching Strategy**: Service worker for offline functionality
- **Asset Optimization**: CDN usage for static assets
- **Lazy Loading**: Modular JavaScript loading
